# QariAI Project Repository

This repository contains the full codebase and scripts developed for the **QariAI MSc Dissertation Project**.  
It is organised into two main components: the mobile learning application and the AI Models for training and evaluation.

---

## ðŸ“± Mobile Application
**Path:** [`Mobile Application/`](./Mobile%20Application)

A React Native (Expo + TypeScript) mobile app that delivers:
- A structured, level-based learning pathway for Arabic/Quranic recitation
- Real-time pronunciation feedback powered by locally trained AI models
- Offline-first functionality for learners in low-connectivity regions

ðŸ‘‰ See the [`Mobile Application/README.md`](./Mobile%20Application/README.md) for setup, installation, and usage instructions.

---

## ðŸ¤– AI Models
**Path:** [`AI Models/`](./AI%20Models)

Python scripts and Jupyter/Colab notebooks used to develop and evaluate the ASR models:
- Dataset loading and preprocessing
- Model architectures (letters, words, and verses)
- Training pipelines with TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluation metrics (Top-1, Top-5, confusion matrices, classification reports)
- Inference demos for single-file predictions

ðŸ‘‰ A separate `README.md` will describe how to run each notebook/script.
