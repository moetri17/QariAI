# QariAI – AI Models

This folder contains the **AI model notebooks** developed for the MSc dissertation project:  
**“Investigation into the use of AI for teaching how to correctly recite Arabic/Quranic text.”**

These models form the backend for the QariAI mobile application, providing pronunciation classification at three levels of complexity: **letters → words → verses**.
